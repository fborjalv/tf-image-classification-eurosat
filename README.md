# tf-image-classification-eurosat

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow for image classification into multiple categories. The goal is to develop a deep learning model capable of identifying and classifying images into various defined categories using the Eurostat dataset.

EuroSAT dataset is based on Sentinel-2 satellite images covering 13 spectral bands and consisting of 10 classes with 27000 labeled and geo-referenced samples.
